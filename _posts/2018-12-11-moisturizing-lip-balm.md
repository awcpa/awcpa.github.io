## Keep Your Lips Moisturized!

Thereâ€™s a great product on the market that takes care of all your lip problems. You can read more [here](https://www.burtsbees.com/lip-care/lip-balm/), or read my product review. (I hope you read my review...)

## Pros and Cons

The best thing about Burt's Bees is that it is made with beeswax. One of the problems for me about their Lip Balm is that some of the flavor are kind of weird.

## Other Options

There are other lip balms out there, but I like Burt's Bees the best. My other favorite brand is [Chapstick](https://www.powder.com/stories/reflections-with-suzy-chapstick-chaffee/).

## Why I Recommend Burt's Bees Moisturizing Lip Balm

I like Burt's Bees the best because I want to support the people who take care of bees. Bees are in danger around the world and I like Burt's Bees business model.
